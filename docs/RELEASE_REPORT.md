# 0.3.0-alpha.1 verification report

Date: 2026-08-28 UTC

## Executed commands

### Environment inspection

Executed OS, CPU, RAM, storage, language/toolchain, GPU, audio, browser, Docker,
and editor checks. Recorded results are in `ENVIRONMENT.md`.

### Compile and regression suite

```bash
make check
```

Latest post-CI-upgrade result: PASS — 32 tests ran in 2.497 seconds; 32 passed,
0 failed, 0 errors.

An earlier `make check` attempt failed during test discovery with five
`ModuleNotFoundError: sparkle` errors because the Makefile omitted
`PYTHONPATH=src`. The Makefile was corrected and the exact command was rerun to
the passing result above.

### Runtime status

```bash
python3 -m sparkle status
```

Result: PASS — process exited 0; model registry, 16 agents, five tools, memory,
knowledge, tracing, automation, voice state, proactive state, and presence state
were reported. Overall runtime state was correctly `limited` because no accepted
MiniMax secret reference exists in the build process.

### Live-provider smoke test

```bash
python3 -m sparkle smoke-test --live
```

Result: BLOCKED — process exited 2 at `credential_presence`; configured was
false and `secret_value_exposed` was false. No API request was made. This is not
a live-provider PASS.

### Secret-pattern inspection

Searched tracked candidate files for `sk-` and `Bearer` patterns. Matches were
limited to documentation placeholders, runtime header construction, and fake
test fixtures. No credential value was found.

## Verified paths

- Model mapping, response parsing, retries, streaming, and tool state.
- Registry add/remove/enable/disable/activate.
- Memory upsert/search/archive and category boundaries.
- Knowledge ingest/chunk/search and format rejection.
- Trace sequence, success/failure metadata, and redaction.
- Automation due selection and proactive deadline alerts.
- Calculator AST and file-path confinement.
- Agent routing, tool loop, multi-agent synthesis.
- HTTP health/chat/memory/knowledge/static dashboard and security headers.

## Not verified

- Real MiniMax network response.
- Production deployment.
- Voice, wake word, camera, browser automation, GUI computer control, or robots.

## GitHub publication

Result: PASS — the source is published to the private repository
`pexxoraa/SPARKLE` on branch `main`. Connector access was limited to the
authorized account and the target repository; no unrelated repository was
modified.

The remote foundation tree
`dd4bd9833f9675cc8333065d2487d5dfb2317312` exactly matches local foundation
commit `d5c001be05193411d7b90b03d09390e2702f8e82`. The imported release-state tree
`66ccd2f802d93e6a0e91494db693936141e64aa9` exactly matches local commit
`01f8e816a55513e647674c21ea12c1ef6e495db2` and is recorded remotely in commit
`9561b1208e5c44d744bf7293fef8a7c6f7ee7361`.

Because the target was an empty repository and the connector's commit API
requires an existing parent, publication includes one bootstrap commit before
the imported foundation and release-state commits. This changes commit IDs but
not the verified file trees.

## GitHub Actions

Result: PASS — SPARKLE CI run #5 completed successfully in 15 seconds for
commit `32be63286ca0ce9b5dd07eea6b07c4942a93a5a9`. Both matrix jobs passed on
Python 3.12 and Python 3.13. The workflow uses `actions/checkout@v7` and
`actions/setup-python@v7`; the successful run reported no annotations.
